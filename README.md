# Flight Path Finder

This app finds the shortest flight path between two airports using three different algorithms: Breadth-First Search (BFS), A* Search, and Dijkstra's algorithm.

## Starting the App
To start the app, simply run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## Technologies Used
The app is divided into two parts: 
* frontend D3, ReactJS and Apollo client
* backend Spring WebFlux and GraphQL
